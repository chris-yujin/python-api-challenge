# python-api-challenge

In this challenge we were tasked to use weather data and city data to conduct analysis of different weather characteristics across the globe. 
We later found information of hotels near the analyzed cities based off of desired weather conditions. 

The weather analysis was conducted in the WeatherPy.ipynb file and the hotel information is located in the WeatherPy.ipynb file. Both are located in the "Starter_Code" directory. 

The output of graphs and the linear regression analysis between a city's latitude and various weather conditions is stored in the "output_data" directory. 

.gitignore was used to untrack the api keys used to connect to the respective APIs.
